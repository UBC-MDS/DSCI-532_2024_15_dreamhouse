# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

To ensure an open and respectful environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, commit to making participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for all, irrespective of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, experience level, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

-   Using welcoming and inclusive language

-   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences

-   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism

-   Focusing on what is best for the community

-   Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

-   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances

-   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks

-   Public or private harassment

-   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission

-   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are tasked with defining clear standards for acceptable behavior and are obligated to implement suitable and equitable corrective measures in response to any instances of unacceptable conduct.

They possess the authority and duty to delete, modify, or refuse comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not adhere to the Code of Conduct. Additionally, they may temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for actions they consider to be inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or detrimental.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct is enforceable in both project-related environments and public settings where an individual represents the project or its community. Representing the project or community entails actions such as utilizing an official project email address, making posts through an official social media account, or serving as a designated representative at events, whether online or in-person. Project maintainers may provide additional definitions and clarifications regarding what constitutes representation of the project.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [zeilygar\@student.ubc.ca](mailto:zeilygar@student.ubc.ca). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Visibility will only be granted to group leaders, which currently include:

-   Ruocong Sun

-   Chun Li

-   Jake Barnabe

-   Zeily Garcia

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
