# American Housing Prices Dashboard

[Find your dream house!](dsci-532-2024-15-dreamhouse-odas.onrender.com/)

## Project Overview

This dashboard presents an interactive visualization of housing prices in top cities and states across top 50 cities in the United States of America. The data is sourced from a comprehensive dataset available on Kaggle, which includes demographics and house prices of the top cities in the United States. Our dashboard is built using the Dash package, enabling users to filter and explore the housing market data across various dimensions, such as state, city, house type, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and more.

## Our Motivation

Millions of people buy their first home every year, and likely lack the market knowledge or experience to know how to find what they’re looking for. We want to help new-comers to the real-estate market by creating a data visualization app to help explore house listings in the United States’ 50 most populous cities. Our app will display listings in each city and will give users the ability to filter by state or city, price, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and other metrics. It will also display the factors that are most heavily associated with price so that uninformed sellers get a good sense of what similar homes are being sold for and help them get the right value in their local market.
